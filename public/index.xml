      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Running Man, Weather Man Austin, Texas is city that boasts great people and great weather. This project explores the running habits of a local Austinite, Steve, who runs all around town and even partakes in ultra-marathons across the country. Since 2013, Steve has recorded data for many, if not most, of his runs in the fitness app, Strava. With Strava, users can record and upload data about a range of activities including running, biking, hiking, or even watersports.</description>

      <description>Food, People, and Other Counts for Texas Counties The USDA broadly defines the term “food desert” as a “neighborhood that lacks healthy food sources.” A given geographic region may be classified as a food desert based on an analysis of various demographic and accessibility factors. The County Health Rankings &amp;amp; Roadmaps survey of Health Data for 2016 provides each county in Texas with a Food Environment Index score, which incorporates measures of grocery store proximity, income level, and food source reliability for each county.</description>
