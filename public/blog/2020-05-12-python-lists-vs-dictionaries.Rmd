# The Difference Between a List and Dictionary in Python

When learning to code with Python, there are several ways to work with sets of data. Lists and dictionaries are both common methods of storing information, but they have several key differences. 

## __Lists__:
A list is simply a set of values, organized and stored in a certain order.
You can create a list and assign it a name like this:
```{python}
list1=["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
list1
list2=[2, 4, 8, 6, 10]
list2
```
The elements in a list are like papers in a filing cabinet. The position of each paper is called an index (think file number) __starting with 0__. In `list1` (the file cabinet), the element `c` is in the *second index* (a.k.a. file #2, to continue the analogy). 

In a filing cabinet, you could take one paper out of a given file and replace it with a different one. You can do the same thing with lists in Python like this:
```{python}
#replace `c` with `cat`
list1[2]="cat"
list1
```
There are many other list functions, which are coded using the format listname.function. Here are a few examples:
```{python}
list2.sort() #order from least to greatest
list2

list2.reverse() #reverse order
list2

list2.append(0) #add zero as a new element
list2
```

## __Dictionaries__
A dictionary is a set of data values that are tied to "keys." It can be helpful to think of a real dictionary where the key is the word you want to define, and the value is the definition. Unlike the way a real dictionary is written in alphabetical order, dictionaries are unordered meaning that the key:value pairs are stored not stored in a designated order.  
```{python}
dog = {
  'name':'Leia',
  'age' : 3,
  'color' : 'black',
  'favorite things' : ['tennis balls', 'swimming', 'the couch'],
}
print(dog)
```
You can edit dictionaries by changing, adding, and removing key:value pairs:
```{python}
dog['age']=3.5 #edit the value for age
dog['barks at']= ['the mail man', 'squirrels'] #add a new key with several values
dog.pop('color') #remove the 'age' key
print(dog)
```

While they each have unique aspects, you can use both lists and dictionaries to write for loops and define new fuctions in your Python code, among other things!
